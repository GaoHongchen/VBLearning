## General
Visual Basic is becoming the programming language of choice for the MultiValue programmers that have to work in the Windows environment. There are actually three flavors of Visual Basic to chose from. Each one has its own special use and advantage.   
The three flavors of Visual Basic are Visual Basic for Applications, VBScript, and Visual Basic. Visual Basic for Applications is primarily thought of in terms of Microsoft Excel to create macros, but that's only a small part of it. VBScript is most commonly used in Active Server Pages and the Internet. Visual Basic has been widely talked about in Spectrum and is considered a full compilable programming language.
